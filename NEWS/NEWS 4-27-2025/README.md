## Pre-launch of MSN At Boot

## TS-KERNEL Supports MSN

By Coolis1362

The TS-KERNEL Kernel Is Choosing The Microsoft Network (MSN) As The Default Network For The TS-KERNEL Kernel. MSN Might Be Old But Unlike Internet Explorer, It Is Now Good with The Modern Web. But TS-NETWORK Might be The Default Network For The TS-KERNEL News. This Change Aims To Enhance Connectivity and User Experience. (Lead)

MSN Was The Default Network Back In the 1990s and 2000s. Many 2000s Kids Used MSN Messenger To Chat With Their Friends. MSN Messenger Was Discontinued In 2013. But MSN Is Now Back With A New Look and Feel. Why MSN? Well, Coolis1362 Uses It For Weather and Sometimes, News!
MSN Is Now A Modern Web Service That Provides News, Weather, and Other Information. It Is A Great Alternative To Other Networks Like Google News and Yahoo News. MSN Is Also Integrated With Microsoft Edge, Which Makes It Easy To Access The News From Your Browser. (Body)

```python

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

# Example Usage

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"BOOT: ERROR: Error Code 634: {e}")
        return False
    print("DONE PROCESS: 100% TIME:", time.time(), datetime.datetime.now(), "BOOTED: Default Network (Microsoft Network (MSN))")
```
